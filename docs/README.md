# Es User Guide

Es is a quiet, observant task assistant for the grand library of dreams, Somniareves.

## Starting Es

Run `es.gui.Launcher` from IntelliJ, or use:

```powershell
$env:GRADLE_USER_HOME = "$pwd\.gradle-home"
.\gradlew.bat run
```

The console launcher is `es.Es`.

## Commands

| Command | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo` | `todo read book` | Add a task without a date |
| `deadline` | `deadline submit report /by 2026-10-15` | Add a task due by a date/time |
| `event` | `event meeting /from 2026-10-15 14:00 /to 2026-10-15 16:00` | Add an event |
| `list` | `list` | Display all tasks |
| `mark` / `unmark` | `mark 2` | Change completion status |
| `delete` | `delete 2` | Remove a task |
| `find` | `find book` | Find whole-word description matches |
| `tag` / `untag` | `tag 1 errand urgent` | Add or remove tags |
| `findtag` | `findtag errand` | Find tasks with a tag |
| `bye` | `bye` | Close the conversation |

## Tags

Tags added during creation require `#`, for example `todo read book #study #quiet`. For `tag`, `untag`, and `findtag`, the `#` is optional. Tags are case-sensitive and duplicates are rejected.

## Dates and conversation

Es accepts dates such as `2026-10-15`, `2026-10-15 18:00`, and `15/10/2026 1800`. Events must end after they begin. Es also understands `hi`, `hello`, `who are you?`, `what are you?`, and `where is this place?`, regardless of letter casing.

Invalid commands, missing arguments, malformed dates, duplicate tags, invalid event periods, and non-existent task numbers are reported without terminating Es. Use single spaces and avoid leading or trailing spaces.

Tasks are saved automatically in `data/es.txt`.
